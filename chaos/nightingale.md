## Robotica Imperialis Warlord Traits

**The machine spirits of semi-autonomous Imperial Robots allow for greatly different means of conducting warfare than Imperial standards.**

If a `ROBOTICA IMPERIALIS` `CHARACTER` is your Warlord, he can choose the following Warlord Trait instead of from the table in the _Warhammer 40,000_ rulebook or relevant codex.

1. Astropathic Effigy

    _The cogitator of a machine spirit commander need not be placed directly in danger. Indeed, it is likely to be most effective when directing the battle safely aboard an orbiting battle-barge, where it can access the fullest extent of such a war machine's processing power._

    If your army is Battle-forged and this model is your Warlord, you receive 2 additional Command Points. When this model is removed from play, it is not considered to have been slain for the purposes of any mission victory conditions.
