## Necron Warlord Traits

**The deranged Lords of the Phaenar Dynasty bring to light new means of fighting the noble Necrontyr of old would have never considered.**

If a `NECRONS` `CHARACTER` is your Warlord, he can choose the following Warlord Trait instead of from the table in the _Warhammer 40,000_ rulebook or _Codex: Necrons_.

1. Not Far from the Tree

    _By harvesting the minds of fallen commanders, this warlord gains intimate knowledge of the weaknesses in the enemy's combat doctrines._

    Each time your Warlord slays an enemy `CHARACTER`, add 2 to your Warlord's Strength and Attacks characteristics until the end of the battle.

## Named Characters and Warlord Traits

If Hatholoeth the Crownjack is your Warlord he must be given the Decapitating Strike Warlord Trait.
