# Example character design process: The Crownjack

## Character concept

The the crownworld of the Phaenar Dynasty of Necrons was a distant Paradise World in the Halo Stars. Undisturbed since the beginning of the Great Sleep, the entire planet of Drangil has been covered in plant life. Most of the members of the dynasty have been corrupted by the shards of the C'tan Lian'gwanil and have become tree-like in nature. They are often slow to act.

Among the nobles who went mad during the Great Sleep and awoke as Destroyers was a Lord named Hatholoeth. Upon learning the state of the galaxy, he decided that this time, the Necrontyr needed to take a firmer, implacable stance toward the corruptions of the Warp. When the ruling counsel of Overlords decided on a slow recovery, Hatholoeth shattered their bodies and assumed control as military dictator. Knowing his own limits, he keeps the Overlords' still-living heads on his body to serve as advisors.

Since the rise of the usurpre Nemesor Hatholoeth, the Crownjack, the Phaenar Dynasty has become increasingly aggressive. More of the nobility are going mad and becoming Destroyers, and the war machines are traveling great distances from the Halo Stars toward the Eye of Terror.

### Technical design

In other words, this army plays as a mostly-immobile Necron gunline with a large number of Destroyers and C'tan shards for mobility. The hero does not support the gunline at all but is focused on forward aggression. In particular, Hathloeth has two focuses -- his hatred of the Warp and his killing of other characters.

## Starting from a datasheet

This is simple for Hatholoeth -- he's a Destroyer Lord. What do we need to change to suit his character concept, though?

### Offensive stats

For starters, let's make him suitably impressive as a Necron `CHARACTER`. Like `Vargard Obyron`, he's a melee-focused character, so let's improve his `WS` to 2+. `Hardwired Hatred` lets him reroll hit rolls of 1, so he's going to reliably hit in melee.

We also know that he's going to be fighting daemons frequently and that he has killed a number of Necron Overlords. It's rare that a regular Necron has greater than `S5` and `T5`, but `Anrakyr the Traveller` does have `S6`. If we give Hatholoeth `S6`, then he's wounding lesser daemons (`T3`) on 2+ and Necron Overlords on 3+.

If we improve it one further to `S7`, then he's wounding Daemon Princes (`T6`) on 3+ and greater daemons (`T7`) on 4+. Quite good considering we haven't assigned him a weapon yet!

### Defensive stats

Even Necron Overlords don't always have a `Sv2+`, so we're going to leave the Destroyer Lord `Sv3+` as it is. Hatholoeth is reckless compared to the rest of his Dynasty, so he wouldn't add extra armor. He doesn't need any extra defenses against daemon attacks, as the standard `Phase Shifter` gives him a solid 4+ invulnerable save.

As a Destroyer Lord, Hatholoeth also has `T6`. This is good but not a particular improvement from `T5`. At best, it keeps other Necron Overlords from wounding him on 2+ with their Voidscythes. Lesser daemons are usually accompanied by Heralds and so have `S4`, which wounds both `T5` and `T6` on 5+. Daemon Princes and greater daemons have `S7` or higher, wounding both `T5` and `T6` on 3+.

It's worthwhile this time to improve the statistic to `T7` in order to reduce the amount of wounds Hatholoeth gets from his favored prey. `T7` is also standard for light `VEHICLE`s and `MONSTER`s, so it doesn't make him particularly resistant to ordinary anti-tank.

Overall, Hatholoeth's `S7`/`T7` profile makes him look quite like a C'tan -- appropriate given the influence of Lian'gwanil on his crownworld.

### Useless abilities

There is one ability which is almost never going to be used. `United in Hatred` is a weaker version of a regular Necron Lord's `The Lord's Will`, which only works on Destroyers in the Shooting Phase instead of all Necrons always. Destroyer Lords are strictly melee units (setting aside the Mephrit sniper build), so this ability simply isn't used on the base unit either.

Ordinarily, being forced to keep a useless ability might be worth a discount. However, becoming a named character didn't make this ability any worse than it already was, so it is not worth a discount.

## Looting abilities from other units

There are two main situations where Hatholoeth should excel -- fighting daemons and killing characters.

### Fighting daemons

A main feature of a Chaos army is psychic powers, and Necrons often lack proper defenses against these. As a generic character, Hatholoeth would take the `Immortal Pride` warlord trait in order to deny a psychic power. However, this should be a core trait for Hatholoeth, even if he's not the warlord. Some Necron units can take the `Gloom Prism` wargear, which grants a deny attempt. We'll simply add this to his datasheet.

#### Invulnerable saves

Another major feature of daemons is that they all have invulnerable saves. Ordinarily, Necrons have high `AP` values, but that is of no help here. Strangely, the Necrons have no native means of affecting invulnerable saves, even though they themselves have relatively strong ones.

We must instead look to other codexes. The `Null Zone` and `Death Hex` psychic powers can deactive them on a successful cast. The Tyranid hive fleet Kronos has the `Balethorn Cannon` relic which disallows invulnerable saves but is not particularly strong against armor.

Deativating invulnerable saves is a particularly strong ability, and the designers are loath to allow it cheaply.

What about mortal wounds? That's certainly a way to get around invulnerable saves. It even makes fluffy sense, given the extensive C'tan contamination. However, inflicting mortal wounds -- especially in the great quantity needed to take down a horde of lesser daemons or a single greater daemon -- would make Hatholoeth very strong against _any_ army.

Let's hold off on adding that sort of ability and consider a way to get around daemonic invulnerability specifically when we discuss the weapon.

### Killing characters

There are a decent number of abilities related to killing characters. Ironically, most of them are in Chaos itself. Roughly, these abilities fall into two categories -- making a character better at killing other characters in the first place (Slaanesh) or making a character better overall after killing characters (Khorne).

Hatholoeth the Crownjack, a madman who wears the still-living severed heads of his former superiors, is definitely the second kind. There's already a warlord trait which does exactly what we want -- `Carve the Runes`, which improves `S` and `A` by 2 for each `CHARACTER` killed.

Since this is a warlord trait, we're going to be a little more conservative. If Hatholoeth is working under another warlord, he's not necessarily going to be running off and decapitating other heroes. Let's make this a new Necron warlord trait and make it mandatory for Hatholoeth.

There _is_ already a character-killer warlord trait for the Necrons, `Honourable Combatant`. That's definitely not our boy.

## Built-in relic

As a Destroyer Lord, Hatholoeth already has the `Phylactery` relic since it was wargear in previous editions. For other relics, the Crownjack would definitely have a weapon. Let's discuss that now.

### Basic stats

We'd encountered the issue of Hatholoeth needing to get through the invulnerable saves of daemons but not necessarily of Space Marine Captains. The simple answer here is volume of attacks. Daemons typically have a poor invulnerable save of 5+. Having a relatively low-damage weapon with a vast number of attacks would make Hatholoeth effective against both hordes of lesser daemons and against greater daemons.

Looking through the Necrons melee weapon list, we don't find much. Necrons are not a particularly melee-focused army, and the Lords typically focus on having high `AP` values instead. Let's think on what we need out of this weapon.

Hatholoeth has a good `S7`, so we can leave the weapon at `S User`. We only need `AP-1` to completely deny an armor saving throw to daemons, but even the humble `Staff of Light` has `AP-2`, so we'll "pay" for that. Damage can be as low as 1, as with the Staff.

### Searching for a multi-hit effect

What we need is a large number of attacks. Destroyer Lords already have a good number of attacks (for Necrons) at 4. A simple option for increasing reliability would be rerolling wound rolls. However, there's no precedent of doing that for Necrons. It's ordinarily just a flat improvement or an "always wound on 2+" effect.

There's also the Tesla effect if we look at ranged weapons -- hit rolls of 6+ generate 3 hits. However, the Tesla effect tends to require full-strength squads of Necron Immortals buffed by `My Will Be Done` to be effective. Tesla weapons also entirely lack `AP`, which would be strange on a melee weapon.

Certainly, we could have the decapitated Overlords whispering a MWBD into Hatholoeth's ears to give him the Tesla effect on 5+, but his damage against a Daemon Prince only improves by 1 wound.

### Looting the other dead boys

However, we can find a weapon which has a very interesting effect which is effective against both hordes and single large units -- the Plague Marine Champion's `Flail of Corruption`. The user makes d3 hit rolls for each attack with the weapon, and any excess damage spills over onto the next model in the unit.

Fighting a Daemon Prince, Hatholoeth's new weapon inflicts 0.84 more wounds on average than a Daemon Prince fighting another Daemon Prince, assuming the standard Malefic Talons loadout. However, fighting lesser daemons, Hatholoeth kills 4.86 more.

### Fixing the Necrons codex

This is still not _great_. Hatholoeth hasn't destroyed a unit yet. He's got higher `T` but is slower and has fewer `W` than a Daemon Prince. He _can_ regenerate wounds from the `Phylactery`, but that requires him to survive the fightback. He also has to survive the drive to the fight and any overwatch (which is more an issue with Chaos Space Marines).

Any sort of concentrated anti-armor is going to take him out. Even in spite of specializing in daemon-killing, he's going to turn into vapor if he confronts a Bloodthirster. On average, he'll inflict 5.19 wounds, but he needs to inflict 8 to degrade it and make his own death worthwhile.

A simple solution to improve his damage is to fix the broken `Hardwired Hatred` ability and turn it back to `The Lord's Will`. This improves his Bloodthirster damage to 6.05. More importantly, this means he kills a Daemon Prince or minimum strength unit of lesser daemons on contact at 8.07 or 10.08 average wounds. Now we're cooking with promethium!

While it would be nice to hurt a greater daemon more than 6 wounds, we've now unlocked a new strategy. `Hardwired Hatred` only affected Destroyers. `The Lord's Will` affects everything. This restores the classic Necrons strategy of running a Destroyer Lord with a screen of Wraiths. It also means that he buffs any units which arrive by other means of Deep Strike.

## Mandatory warlord trait

As we discussed, Hatholoeth has a unique warlord trait which makes him even more powerful as he kills characters. Since his attacks characteristic translates to d3 attacks with his relic weapon, he becomes an unliving blender quite quickly. This offsets the setup time of the trait and its relatively restricted nature. By quirk of army design, he's also terribly effective at wiping out Genestealer Cults.

## Abstractions are your friend

In the end, Hatholoeth's big, scary weapon is _just_ the Plague Marine Champion `Flail of Corruption`. If we consider the Destroyer Lord's base `S5`, the profile is exactly the same -- `S +2`, `AP -2`, `D 2`. Likewise, the effect is the same, as Plague Marines have an inherent reroll wound rolls of 1 effect on `Plague Weapon`. The only difference is that Hatholoeth has 4 attacks instead of 2.

There was no need to invent any special rules because they already existed. Likewise, I didn't need to change his attacks characteristic to a big, scary number because the weapon handled it for me.

## Now that I'm done, does it actually work?

`S7` and `T7` puts Hatholoeth ahead of other Necron characters and edges out a Daemon Prince in defense. However, he's slightly slower than a winged Daemon Prince or any greater daemon other than the Great Unclean One. He's also lacking in support. He had no ability to make it across the board beyond his solid `Mv10"`, and he has no options for improving charges.

Adding `The Lord's Will` does allow him to take an escort of Wraiths instead of just a screen of Scarabs. Since Destroyers are still `INFANTRY` for some reason, he can also be targeted for any of the Necrons movement exploits. The Tomb Stalker can also be brought along, and you don't need to buy the Gloom Prism on it since Hatholoeth already has one. Still, no matter what you bring, that 9" is a long way to charge.

At the very least, let's add one more ability to him to represent the decapitated Overlords -- an _aura_ of `My Will Be Done`. This is potentially very powerful, but Hatholoeth is liable to be such an expensive character anyway, I can't imagine someone buying him just to buff a gunline. On the other hand, there's no reason to weaken it since he may need to buff a small gunline after Deep Strike.

## How much does this bad boy cost?

Clearly, I've broken one of my early rules. This unit is very clearly better than any other melee HQ in the Necrons army. This is because Necrons melee is _not great_. As such, Hatholoeth is most comparable to `Kutlakh the World Killer`. Kutlakh is overpriced, however, and is not personally very potent. Rather, Kutlakh's list is exploiting the rules to pretend `Warscythe`-bearing Lychguard are Harlequins.

Like Kutlakh, Hatholoeth is a force multiplier, but for the much more effective Canoptek Wraiths. And may the God-Emperor have mercy on your soul if a player somehow managed to get `Anrakyr the Traveller` up the field with Hatholoeth, granting `+1A` to all `NECRON` `INFANTRY`.

Comparing even this cheese to current releases makes you feel bad for xenos armies. Compare Hatholoeth to the generic Lord Discordant, another buffing melee-focused character. Against a Daemon Prince, 8.07 wounds from the Necron vs 9.53 from the Chaos Space Marine. The Lord Discordant has twice as many wounds and buffs daemon engines quite significantly. It costs 38 points fewer than Kutlakh, and you can take 3 of them.

So as for cost, Hatholoeth is 200pts, the same as a Transcendant C'tan. The PL is 10, to account for the cost reduction of C'tan.
