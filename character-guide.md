# Creating a custom character

The battle for Brandius has called forth many mighty heroes. Some you may know, but others may be new faces. Let's discuss how they arrived at the battlefront.

## Getting started

In order to build your new hero, you'll need to decide how to generate their basic stats.

### Character concept

What sort of hero is this new character? Are they a leader of their troops or a lone wolf? Do they charge headlong into the enemy or make calm decisions from the rear? Consider how your army fights and the culture that has developed from it.

### Starting from a datasheet

Most of the time, a new character can be derived from an existing unit type. In this case, the first step is simply to copy that unit's datacard and point values. If the unit which would become a character is comprised of multiple models, divide the cost by the minimum size, rounding up. Simply add `CHARACTER` to the new datacard's keywords.

In most cases, you should also change the organization slot to HQ, but you may be able to make a case for keeping the character in its existing slot, such as for the support characters in Genestealer Cults. In some cases, the character may become too powerful and should be changed to a `Lord of War`. We'll come back to that later.

### Starting from scratch

Some heroes may be so unique that you can't start from any existing datasheet. Consider whether this character still suits the nature of the army. If you _do_ need a brand new sort of character, how does it compare to similar characters in other armies? You may be able to use another army's datasheet as the base.

If you do need to start from scratch, carefully consider one to three things that the character should be able to do effectively. More than that, and you risk a unit too expensive to run. Plus, weaknesses can be fun characterizing opportunities.

When building a unit from scratch, consider how it will interact with the rest of the army. Is there a certain unit you intend to have as a bodyguard or to be supported by this character? Are they a lone wolf?

## Adding new abilities

Here's where you'll really add flavor to your characters. Don't just think about what strong options are in the game but about what would be fun. An ability which doesn't always work may be more fun when it does -- and a points discount when it doesn't.

### Looting abilities from other units

The simplest place to get abilities for your character is simply to look at other datasheets, including those from other armies. There may be another character with a similiar concept whose abilities you can borrow.

### Built-in relic

Note that you cannot take a relic on a named character. Each is assumed to already be taking a relic. If there's a particular relic you always take with the character using a generic datasheet, consider adding it to their datasheet directly. You may also want to customize it for their benefit. It doesn't have to be an exact match of the version in the codex, and you don't have to choose just one. Most Necron characters have the Phylactery relic in addition to their own unique equipment, because it was just wargear in earlier codexes.

### Mandatory warlord trait

Each named character has a specific warlord trait which must always be taken. Consider whether you want to invent a new warlord trait to fulfill this purpose. However, you may not always want to take this character as your warlord, so make sure it isn't a trait which is fundamental to their character. If you ordinarily give them something a little boring, like an extra attack, consider just adding that to their datasheet. Instead, try to design a warlord trait which enhances their ability to command or their ability to move into position.

### Abstractions are your friend

"Being run over by a boat is basically the same as getting hit by a powerfist, right?"

In the end, many abilities are just numbers. Many weapons have different descriptions but behave the same. Instead of trying to invent new weapons and the like, see if it's possible to copy the rules from something else and change the name.

## Wrapping up

### Now that I'm done, does it actually work?

In your excitement to give your hero cool abilities, you may not be adding the _right_ abilities. They may be good at killing -- but not the enemies you wanted. They may be almost indestructible but can't hurt a fly. Spend some time doing the math to see if your character succeeds in the original goal you made for them.

### How much does this bad boy cost?

There's no hard and fast rules here (yet). The easiest way to get a figure is to compare your newly-minted hero to a similar unit. If your new hero is a chaff-killer, compare it to the best chaff-killer in your army. Is there any reason to ever take the old one? Is your hero just too strong, or is the old one still good as a budget pick?

You also need to consider durability. Does your hero die before they can fight? Does your hero never die and allow you to tie up a large portion of your opponent's resources? How much tougher is your hero than the toughest unit of their type? If you made a Devastator Captain, how much tougher is he than a Devastator Sergeant? How much does that extra toughness help?
