# Escape from Trazyn's Vault ruleset

## Terminology

- Hero: A player's customized model. Each Team may only have one Hero, barring specific rules.
- Crew: Any model a player controls which shares the same subfaction.
- Merc: Any model a player controls which does not share the same subfaction.
- Team: All models controlled by a single player.
- Up: The model can be interacted with normally.
- Down: The model can take no actions and can only be targeted by special actions.
- Out: The model is removed from the board. It should be placed to the side to be used if targeted by a specific effect.

## Basic gameplay

- All distances (Movement, Range, etc) are divided by 3 and rounded up. This value is the number of hexes.
- To determine a Team's initiative each round, roll D6 and add the Hero's Movement in hexes.
- In a round, each Team takes their activations in order of initiative.
- Each model in a team may activate twice.
- On a Team's turn, the Team gains 1 Command Point if its Hero is Up.
- Command Points may be spent on any Faction or core rulebook Kill Team Tactics.

## Injury

- When a Crew or Merc model has lost all of its wounds, it is immediately Down. If the model is also part of a hostile Team and does not have Reanimation Protocols, it is instead Out.
- If a hostile model with Reanimation Protocols suffers enough damage from a single attack to destroy it twice (e.g. a 2W model suffering 4 damage), it is immediately Out.
- When a Hero model has lost all of its wounds, it immediately suffers 1 flesh wound. Any damage from further attacks is converted to additional flesh wounds. Any Hero with more than 3 flesh wounds is Down.
- If a model loses its last wound to a mortal wound, the model is immediately Out unless it is a Hero, in which case it is immediately Down.

### Healing

- After a battle is over, each Team's non-combat staff can recover 2 wounds, split across the Team as necessary.
- Removing all flesh wounds from a model and restoring it to 1 wound counts as healing 1 wound.
- Changing a Down model to Up counts as healing 1 wound.

### Down models

- When a model is Down, it can no longer be affected by most actions.
- An activation can be used to take a Down hostile Out.
- Down models still on the field will be abandoned when all Up models enter the exit zone. These are treated as Out.


### Carrying models

- Any time a model occupies the same hex as a Down friendly, it may begin carrying that model.
- While a model is carrying a friendly, it is treated as Falling Back. Move the Down model with the carrying model. The Down model is not treated as occupying the carrying model's hex.
- Try not to laugh when you see an eldar carrying a terminator.

## Building a Team

- Each Team has 2 hexes of space in the deployment zone. The Team may consist of as many models fit in that zone.
- 25mm and 28mm bases fill 1/3 hex.
- 32mm and Small Flying bases fill 1/2 hex.
- Biker bases are considered 2 32mm bases which must occupy 2 adjacent hexes. 2 Biker bases may not occupy the same 2 hexes.
- 40mm, 50mm, and Large Flying bases fill 1 hex.
- Larger base sizes are not permitted, except by specific rules.
- The campaign itself will specify the number of points which may be used to construct a Team. These points may be spent on building the Hero or to purchase Crew or Mercs.
- Models on a team may be any model which is not already a CHARACTER.

## Building a Hero

- A Hero may not be a BEAST or SWARM. It may not be any model which must be manned by another model, such as a Thunderfire Cannon.
- In battle, each Team may only have 1 Hero. There are no limit to the number of Heroes on the Team's roster.

### Equipment

- The cost of the cost of all equipment should be based on the Munitorum Field Manual or latest errata. Divide all costs by 1/3 and round up, minimum 1.
- Heroes may purchase additional equipment they do not take into every battle in order to change their loadout. If they do so, equipment which costs 0 points instead costs 1.
- Heroes may purchase any equipment. Equipment within the faction has no surcharge. Equipment within the same meta-faction (ex. Imperium) costs 1 additional point. Equipment from another faction costs 3 additional points and must be approved by the other players.
- In battle, Heroes may only carry 1 piece of equipment which grants an extra effect (ex. banner).
- In battle, Heroes may take 2 Melee or ranged weapons. If a Hero takes 2 ranged weapons, 1 must be a Pistol. If a Hero takes 2 of the same Melee weapon, they gain 1 Attack.
- In battle, Hero may use any weapon used by a model of its hex size or smaller. A Hero may use a weapon from a model 1 hex size larger. If it does, it may only use that weapon.

### Advancement

- Each Hero should have a custom Specialism from Kill Team Annual 2019 -OR- the Psyker Specialism from Kill Team Commanders. No other Specialism is allowed.
- A Team may spend 4xp to increase a Hero's level by 1.
- Once a Hero's level has reached 4, additional improvements may be purchased as described below.
- A hero stops progressing at level 10. They may continue to accrue XP for their Team.

#### Options for levels 5-10

- The Hero gains any valid statistic improvement from the Character Customization section in Chapter Approved 2018.
- For the cost of 2 levels, the Hero gains any special ability from the Character Customization section in Chapter Approved 2018.
